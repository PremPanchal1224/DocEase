# üìÑ DocEase ‚Äì Your Intelligent Document Assistant

DocEase is an Android application that simplifies working with documents by providing intelligent summaries and answering questions based on document content. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, combining local processing with a powerful hosted Large Language Model (LLM) for accurate, context-aware responses.

## üîÑ System Workflow

### üì• Importing Documents
Users can upload PDF and DOCX documents.  
- `PDFReader.kt` uses **iTextPDF**
- `DOCXReader.kt` uses **Apache POI**

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Chunking and Text Preprocessing
- Extracted text is split into overlapping "chunks" using `WhiteSpaceSplitter.kt`.  
- Ensures semantic continuity across segments  
- Enhances retrieval accuracy during semantic search

### üìä Embedding and Vector Storage
- Each chunk is embedded using the **all-MiniLM-L6-V2** model via `SentenceEmbeddingProvider.kt`, and stored in **ObjectBox**, a fast on-device NoSQL vector DB.  
- Embeddings indexed with `chunkId` for efficient search

### üîé Semantic Search and Query Handling
- User queries are embedded and compared against stored chunks using cosine similarity.  
- Retrieves top-K relevant chunks based on semantic similarity

### ü§ñ LLM-based Answer Generation
- Retrieved chunks and the query are integrated into a dynamic prompt template.  
- Sent to **Gemini-1.5-Flash** via the **Gemini Android SDK**  
- Returns a fluent and contextually accurate answer
